## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned about using flexbox and grid together.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped me to understand flexbox properties. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward
